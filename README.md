================

Apply SECOMPAX to work with wah in bitmap index for FastBit. FastBit is a successful archival data management software using bitmap index to accerlate the query speed. 

SECOMPAX is a new bitmap index encoding algorithm, which is the abbreviations of Scope-Extended COMPressed Adaptive indeX. SECOMPAX is a descent of COMPAX with new designed codebook.

SECOMPAX performs better compression ratio and fast encoding speed compared with the state-of-the-art bitmap index compression  algorithm, such as WAH (Word-Aligned-Hybrid), PLWAH(Position list word aligned hybrid) and COMPAX (COMPressed Adaptive indeX).
